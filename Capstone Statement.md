Capstone Statement:

This project will attempt to classify and interpret breast cancer malignancy using multiple approaches:

- Traditional Interpretable Models:
    - Classify relevant gene expression between Primary and malignant tumors

- Image Classification: 
    - ConvNet for histopathology images of benign and malignant
        - cell segmentation and thresholding techniques
        - interpretability exploration of ConvNets
